    "The data scenario is deaths in Australia from 2012 to 2022, which includes every state and suburb. The aim is to discover what percentage of the population is dying in each suburb, and if the percentage of people who die is affected by the amount of people in a suburb. This is the link to where the data was found, which is from Australian Bureau of Statistics https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/deaths-australia/latest-release#data-downloads. The data is free and accessible from the ABS website, and it is a csv file. The data will be accessed by opening the csv file in Microsoft Excel. "

    "- Data Privacy of Source: The data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), which is a government organisation responsible for collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical information. They must follow Australian privacy laws, including the Privacy Act 1988, which governs how personal information is handled. The ABS is responsible for protecting sensitive personal information such as name, age, gender or phone number. If they don't, they are breaking the law and it makes it extremely dangerous for the individuals whose information can will exposed. This leads to impersonating or phishing, which will cause a lot of harm to individuals. \n",

    "- Application Data Privacy: The responsibilities in maintaining user privacy is the same. Even though the data from ABS is anonymised, it must be ensured that no further identifiable information is added. If the software collects user data, it must be ensured that this data is handled securely. If the software were to be made publicly available, there would be a responsibility in protecting any data that users input into the system. This includes ensuring that the application complies with relevant privacy laws and that users' data is not shared without consent.\n",

    "- Cyber Security: User Authentication: This involves verifying the identity of a user before granting access to the system. It usually requires users to provide credentials such as a username and password, but can also include two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security Password Hashing: Instead of storing passwords in plain text, which is vulnerable to theft, passwords should be hashed using a cryptographic algorithm. Hashing converts the password into a fixed-length string of characters, which cannot be easily reversed back into the original password. This ensures that even if the data is breached, the passwords remain secure. Encryption: Encryption is the process of converting data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. In the context of cybersecurity, it should be applied to data both at rest (stored data) and in transit (data being transferred). Encryption ensures that sensitive information, such as personal data or communication between the user and the server, is protected from eavesdropping or interception.\n"
