    "The data scenario is deaths in Australia from 2012 to 2022, which includes every state and suburb. The aim is to discover what percentage of the population is dying in each suburb, and if the percentage of people who die is affected by the amount of people in a suburb. This is the link to where the data was found, which is from Australian Bureau of Statistics https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/deaths-australia/latest-release#data-downloads. The data is free and accessible from the ABS website, and it is a csv file. The data will be accessed by opening the csv file in Microsoft Excel. "
